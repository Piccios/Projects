# Lorenzo's Portfolio

This project represents my personal portfolio, a junior full-stack developer with a particular focus on frontend technologies. The website allows visitors to view completed projects and contact me via a form.

## Project Description

The portfolio is organized into three main sections:

1. **Main Page**: Contains a brief introduction, a picture of Lorenzo, and links to other sections of the website.
2. **Index**: Lists completed projects hosted on GitHub, with direct links to the repositories.
3. **Contact**: Contains a form for sending messages via email and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: The main framework used to build the user interface.
- **Vite**: Used for project setup and resource bundling.
- **SCSS**: For customized styling and the use of variables and mixins for modular design.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive layout and to simplify the creation of UI components.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity and client-side logic.
- **HTML5**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Basic styling and layout.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into different pages, each managed using **Vue Router**:

- `App.vue`: Contains the basic structure of the site with the navbar and router.
- `Home.vue`: The main page of the portfolio.
- `Projects.vue`: Displays all completed projects.
- `Contact.vue`: Page with the contact form.
